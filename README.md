# Simply Secure Project: Melody-Based Security System

The "Simply Secure" system is an innovative security solution that reimagines traditional locks with a melody-based unlocking mechanism. This system combines audio-based passcode entry with automated security features, providing a user-friendly and highly secure alternative to conventional locking methods.

### Features

* **Melody-Based Unlocking:** Users create and replay a custom passcode melody using a capacitive touch button and a rotary dial. The pitch of the sound changes with the dial's position, allowing for unique and customizable passcodes.
* **Capacitive Touch Input:** A single capacitive touch button is used for interacting with the system, simplifying the user interface.
* **Rotary Dial with Speaker Feedback:** The rotary dial interacts with an onboard speaker to generate sound, with the pitch changing based on the dial's position.
* **Automated Security Functions:**
    * **Auto-Lock Mechanism:** Engages automatically when the user moves away, managed by an ultrasonic ping sensor.
    * **LED Illumination:** LEDs illuminate when the user approaches, providing visual feedback.
    * **Built-in Alarm System:** Activates if the door remains open for an extended period, with the duration configurable via software.
* **Proximity Detection:** Utilizes an ultrasonic ping sensor for both auto-lock and LED illumination features.
